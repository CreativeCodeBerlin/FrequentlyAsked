# So you want to learn Creative Coding

Welcome!

Creative Coding is a loosely defined term used to describe a wide range of artistic practices that use computer code as a medium. Creative Code typically distinguishes itself from regular coding by the fact that it doesn't follow pre-defined specifications, and is aimed at expressing ideas and concepts rather than solving specific problems for a user.

Getting started in any new field can feel overwhelming. You don't know what is possible or even what terms to look up online. This page is meant to help beginners by offering some basic context and answer some commonly asked questions. It is not meant to be a comprehensive list of tools or resources, but a starting point for your creative code journey.


## Frequently Asked Questions

“Which language/tool should I learn?”
This depends a lot on what you want to do, but it also doesn't matter as much as most people think. The basic principles of programming are transferable between most languages, and you'll likely try a few different tools before settling on the one that works for you. If you're not sure how to decide and you just want to start somewhere, (p5.js)[https://p5js.org] is a great choice. For younger artists, (Scratch)[https://scratch.mit.edu/] is a perfect way to get into coding.

### “I want to learn shaders, what should I do?"
For an easy way in, try (The Book of Shaders)[https://thebookofshaders.com] by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo and Jen Lowe. For inspiration, have a look at what people make on (Shadertoy)[https://www.shadertoy.com/].
Keywords: HLSL, GLSL, RayMarching, Metal(iOS)
Tools: Shadertoy, openFrameworks

### “How can I use music or my microphone to make things move on screen?”
One fun way to get into creative coding is to make something audio-reactive. For example (bouncing a ball)[https://p5js.org/examples/sound-mic-input.html] based on the volume of your microphone input.

## Technologies

### Languages/Toolkits/Frameworks

**Scratch:**

**Processing:** Creative Coding tool/language Based on Java (and Python). It's meant to be easy to learn for artists and designers. There is a large community and a lot of resources online. Often used in schools to teach programming to art students. Good for interactive installations, generative design, and as a Swiss-Army knife of creative code tools.
Platform: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Licensing: Free and Open Source.
Website: https://processing.org/

**p5.js:** The javascript-based younger cousin of Processing. With the online editor at https://editor.p5js.org/ there is nothing to install and you can get coding straight away. Like Processing, it has a large community and lots of learning resources online. Good for generative visuals, web-based art, and if you want to show your work online.
Licensing: Free and Open Source.
Website: http://p5js.org

**OpenFrameworks:** Open source toolkit designed for creative coding,  written in C++ and built on top of OpenGL. Good if you already know C++, care about performance, or want to build more complex projects.
Licensing: Free and Open Source.
Website: https://openframeworks.cc

**Python:** a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Interesting modules / libraries:
